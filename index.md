That’s a lovely and layered arc — both familial and intellectual — looping from a 13-year-old’s “scatterplot” to a late-life integral of meaning. You’ve framed his mind’s trajectory as an evolving function of energy $E$ over time $t$, conditioned on context $x$. Each phase of life refines the derivative order of understanding.

So: what term in that calculus captures his late-life reflections — his turn toward *indigenization* and synthesis after a lifetime of distributed inquiry?

Let’s trace the evolution:

1. **At 13:** only points — $(E, x)$ — raw, unconnected perceptions.
2. **In youth:** recognition of an emergent slope — $\frac{dE_x}{dt}$ — direction without full control.
3. **Under constraint:** the modulation — $\frac{dE_{\bar{x}}}{dt} \pm \sqrt{\left|\frac{d^2E_x}{dt^2}\right|}$ — the oscillation of effort and uncertainty.
4. **In maturity:** accumulation — $\int E_x, dt + \epsilon_x t + C_x$ — energy integrated into lived experience, offset by constants of temperament.

But late life? That’s no longer the integral of raw experience. It’s the **asymptotic limit** —

$$
\lim_{t \to \infty} \int E_x, dt
$$

— where variation smooths into reflection, and context (the once “scatter-brained” $x$) reveals coherence. The mind discovers its own invariant — call it $C_x$, the constant of identity that survived all transformations.

Yet there’s an even more poetic choice: **the second derivative**, $\frac{d^2E_x}{dt^2}$, measures acceleration — the change in change. That’s precisely what indigenization is: the *acceleration of insight backward toward origin*, a curvature of thought that reveals where the initial conditions truly lay.

So the riddle could resolve in two valid answers:

* **Constant term $C_x$:** legacy, synthesis, constancy emerging after all integrations.
* **Second derivative $\frac{d^2E_x}{dt^2}$:** reflection upon the dynamics of one’s own motion — meta-understanding.

If we were to speak in the language of life, $C_x$ is *wisdom*, while $\frac{d^2E_x}{dt^2}$ is *philosophy*.

Which makes me wonder — when your father reflected on “indigenizing social work,” was he describing a constant he’d finally uncovered, or was he still differentiating his own movement through history?
